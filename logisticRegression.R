# so we make the model (Survived ~ age)
# In other words, we're representing the relationship between Age (x) and Survived (y).
# If you use a different data set, or want to try different inputs, you'll need to change the model!!
# Note: Formulas in R take the form (y ~ x).

#   SibSp indicates the number of siblings/spouses aboard the Titanic, Parch indicates the number of parents/children aboard the Titanic
#   Fare is the fare paid for ticket
